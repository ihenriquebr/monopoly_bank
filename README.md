# My first project
Everything that I applied to this project I learned in the [Basic Python Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvE-ZAFRgX8hnECDn1v9HNTI71veL3oW0) from Curso em VÃ­deo on YouTube.<br />
According to [Wakatime](https://github.com/wakatime/vscode-wakatime), I spent 19hrs and 41mins.<br />
It's a simple project, but it's also a big step for me. Thank you!
